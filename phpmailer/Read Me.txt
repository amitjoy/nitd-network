If you've spent weeks scratching your head trying to work out how to send Social engine email notifications via SMTP then this is the mod for you. 

We developed it out of frustration after finding an ad for something similar on the Social engine site but then not being able to develop it.

You only need to mod a few files and then you can decide to route your site emails through any SMTP server.e.g. Googleapps.
